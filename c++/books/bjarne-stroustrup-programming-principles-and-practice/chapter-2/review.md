# Review for Chapter 2

1. The purpose of the Hello World program is to introduce basic syntax and
to verify that you have a working dev/compile/run environment.

2. The four parts of a function:
 - name
 - parameters
 - return type
 - body

3. The main function must appear in every C++ program.

4. The return 0 in the HelloWorld program is an exit code indicating success.

5. The purpose of the compiler is to a. check if your code is grammatically
correct, and b) produce object code from source code.

6. The include directive brings outside code into your program and allows
it to be accessed.

7. A .h suffix indicates a _header file_, which has definitions of terms.

8. A linker brings together many translational units and links them together. A
translation unit can be thought of as a source code file.

9. Source code is the stuff we write; object code is the stuff the computer
reads. Source code can be compiled on different systems; object code is not
always portable.

10. Vim and command line for life, man.

11. Raw comprehension isn't enough. You must practice to become a true master.
