// There is an old story that the emperor wanted to thak the inventor
// of the game of chess and asked the inventor to name his reward.
// The inventor asked for one grain of rice of the first square,
// 2 for the second, 4 for the third, and so on, doubling for each
// of the 64 squares. That may sound modest, but there wasn't enough
// rice in the empire to satisfy the request! Write a program to calculate
// how many squares are required to give the inventor at least 1000 grains
// of rice, at least 1,000,000 grains, at least 1,000,000,000 grains.
