// Try to calculate the number of rice grains the emperor asked for in
// exercise 8. You'll find that the number is so large that it won't fit
// in an int or a double. Observe what happens when the number gets too large
// to represent exactly as an int and as a double. What is the largest number
// of squares for which you can calculate the exact number of grains the (using
// an int)? What is the largest number of squares for which you can calculate
// the approximate number of grains using a double?
