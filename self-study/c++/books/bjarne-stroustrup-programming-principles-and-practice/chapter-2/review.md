# Review for Chapter 2

1. The purpose of the Hello World program is to introduce basic syntax and
to verify that you have a working dev/compile/run environment.

2. The four parts of a function:
 - name
 - parameters
 - return type
 - body

3. The main function must appear in every C++ program.

4. The return 0 in the HelloWorld program is an exit code indicating success.

5. The purpose of the compiler is to a. check if your code is grammatically
correct, and b) produce object code from source code.

6. The include directive brings outside code into your program and allows
it to be accessed.

7. A .h suffix indicates a _header file_, which has definitions of terms.

8. A linker brings together many translational units and links them together. A
translation unit can be thought of as a source code file.

9. Source code is the stuff we write; object code is the stuff the computer
reads. Source code can be compiled on different systems; object code is not
always portable.

10. Vim and command line for life, man.

11. Raw comprehension isn't enough. You must practice to become a true master.

# Definitions exercise.

```
<<: output operator
C++: general-purpose multi-paradigm language
comment: part of the code written only for humans; ignored by compiler
compile-time error: error found by compiler
cout: character output stream
executable: file that can be run as program. object code.
function: block of code with name, args, body, return type
header: file with definitions
IDE: vim
#include: directive to bring in other source code
library: code written externally that you can include
linker: occurs after compilation; links sources together
main(): function that auto-runs in C++ programs
object code: code that the machine reads and executes
output: stuff that comes out of a function or program
program: series of steps, written in code, executed by machine
source code: the stuff humans write that gets compiled into object code
statement: atomic unit of instruction
```
