## Stages of Development

- _Analysis_: Figure out what should be done and write a description of your
(current) understanding of that. This is a _set of requirements_ or a
_specification_. _[Recall that PMs have praised me in the past for my tendency
to ask clarifying questions, to surface all of my assumptions (if any). It has
been helpful in the past &mdash; try to reinforce this trait and keep it up.]_
- _Design_: Create an overall structure for the system, deciding which parts
the implementation should have and how those parts should communicate. As part
of the design consider which tools &mdash; such as libraries &mdash; can help
you structure the program. _[In the past, I have been commended for my design
instincts and intuition &mdash; that I often have the correct ideas about how
to design systems. However, I'd like to offer myself a place to improve: be
especially skeptical of this intuition. Although it may be true that it often
is right in hard to evaluate ways that surface later, it is always important
to formally enumerate, evaluate, and empirically probe these intuitions.]_
- _Implementation_: Execution stage. In this I bundle: A. write the code, debug
it, test that it actually does what it is supposed to do. B. Maintain the code.
C. Improve the code over time.
