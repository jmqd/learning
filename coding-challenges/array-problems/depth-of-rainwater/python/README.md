Rainfall Sitting Water Depth
---

Imagine a 2D island jutting out from the ocean. Sea-level is height 0.
Due to the topology of the island, some areas will collect rainfall.
Imagine that this world has no evaporation, and that it rains enough
such that all points on this island have their maximum potential depth
of rainfaill collected.

You're given an array of intgers that represent the height of the island.
Write a solution that can return the depth of the water at any given point,
when queried.
