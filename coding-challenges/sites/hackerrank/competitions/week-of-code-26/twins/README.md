Lia is fascinated by anything she considers to be a twin.
She calls a pairs of positive integers i and j twins if:

- They are both prime. A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has
no positive divisors other than and itself.
- Their absolute difference is exactly equal to 2 (i.e., |j - i| = 2).

Given an inclusive interval of integers from n to m, can you help Lia find the
number of pairs of twins there are in the interval (i.e., [n, m])? Note that
pairs (i, j) and (j, i) are considered to be the same pair.
