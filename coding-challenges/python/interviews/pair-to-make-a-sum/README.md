# pair of ints from array summing to k

Given an array A and an integer k, return the indices of a given
pair of integers within the array. Variants of the problem are also
approached, including assuming that the array is sorted, assuming that the
array will only contain positive integers, and exploring difference time/space
constraints.

Four solutions are presented as well as some logging and
a minimal test harness.
