# No Idea! (A set problem. Apparently.)

There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B,
each containing m integers. You like all the integers in set A and dislike
all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0. For each integer i
in the array, if i is a member of A, you add 1 to your happiness.
If i is a member of B, you add -1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness
does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.
