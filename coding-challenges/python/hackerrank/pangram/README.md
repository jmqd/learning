# problem: determining if input string s is a pangram

Roy wanted to increase his typing speed for programming contests. So, his
friend advised him to type the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the
lazy dog" repeatedly, because it is a pangram. (Pangrams are sentences
constructed by using every letter of the alphabet at least once.)

After typing the sentence several times, Roy became bored with it. So he started to look for other pangrams.

Given a sentence s, tell Roy if it is a pangram or not.
