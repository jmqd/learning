integers (a, b) where a < b that exist such that the equation x * a + y * b = n
(where  and  are positive integers) has at least one solution.

Input Format

A single positive integer denoting n.

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the number of such pairs.

## My notes:

Manually solved these as test cases:

4 => 2
8 => 10
11 => 18
