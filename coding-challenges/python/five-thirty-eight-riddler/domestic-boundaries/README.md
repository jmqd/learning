## the problem

### From Stephen Carrier, a puzzle about domestic boundaries:

Consider four square-shaped ranches, arranged in a two-by-two pattern, as if part of a larger checkerboard. One family lives on each ranch, and each family builds a small house independently at a random place within the property. Later, as the families in adjacent quadrants become acquainted, they construct straight-line paths between the houses that go across the boundaries between the ranches, four in total. These paths form a quadrilateral circuit path connecting all four houses. This circuit path is also the boundary of the area where the familiesâ€™ children are allowed to roam.

What is the probability that the children are able to travel in a straight line from any allowed place to any other allowed place without leaving the boundaries? (In other words, what is the probability that the quadrilateral is convex?)

# the solution

_Simulated by solution.py script._

### General strategy of simulation:

- Uniformly at random generate a point within each quadrant.
- Starting from the "top left", moving clockwise, traverse the points, applying a numerical `orientation test` to check if the polygon formed from the four points is convex or not.
- Repeat this process N times and compute the observed frequency of convex polygons.

## Results

- In 10,000,000 simulations, found 906320 occurences of concave polgons.
- Estimated/observed probability: 0.909368
