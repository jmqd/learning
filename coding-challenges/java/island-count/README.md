# Count the islands in a grid.

Given a grid (an array of arrays) where 1 represents land and 0 represents
water, and any contiguous portion of land (horizontal or vertially adjacent)
is considered the same island, write an algorithm to count the number of
islands in the grid.

Example:

```
{ 0, 1, 0, 1 },
{ 0, 1, 0, 1 },
{ 0, 0, 1, 0 }
```

## There are three islands in this grid.
